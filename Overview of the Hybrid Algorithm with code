Overview of the Hybrid Algorithm
You are solving a complex multi-objective optimization problem using three stages:

Teacher Phase (TLBO)

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Phase

Learner Phase (TLBO)

This approach balances exploration (finding new areas of solution space) and exploitation (refining good solutions).

üßÆ Initialization
matlab
Copy
Edit
clc; clear all;
Set constants for PSO:

wmax, wmin: inertia weights (balance exploration & convergence)

c1, c2: acceleration coefficients (how much particle learns from itself and others)

Define lower bound (lb) and upper bound (ub) of variables:

The first values are location indices for EVCS and DGs.

The later values are DG sizes (complex numbers).

matlab
Copy
Edit
ns = 100;   % number of particles (solutions)
nv = number of decision variables (20)
Randomly initialize solutions and convert to real parameter values using convert_pv.

üßÆ Objective Function Evaluation
matlab
Copy
Edit
obj = evuci1(pv);
Calls your custom function evuci1 to compute:

EV Consumer Cost Index (EVCCI)

Power Loss Index

Combines both into a single fitness value (obj) using weights w1, w2.

üßë‚Äçüè´ 1. TEACHER PHASE (TLBO)
matlab
Copy
Edit
[tpvobj] = teacherh(pvobj, lb, ub);
Learns from the best solution in the population (teacher).

Updates population based on how far students are from the teacher.

This helps quickly improve solutions with better convergence.

üê¶ 2. PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION (PSO)
‚öôÔ∏è Initial Setup:
matlab
Copy
Edit
vel = 0.1 * pv;
pbest = pv;         % best position seen by each particle
gbest = pv(best);   % best global solution
üîÅ Main PSO Update Loop:
matlab
Copy
Edit
for i = 1:ns
  for j = 1:nv
    vel(i,j) = ...
    pv(i,j) = ...
Updates position and velocity of each solution based on:

Its personal best (pbest)

The global best (gbest)

Random learning factors

Velocity and position are bounded by limits defined by lb and ub.

üéØ Update Best Solutions:
matlab
Copy
Edit
if f1 < f0
  pbest(i,:) = pv(i,:);
  f0 = f1;
end
Updates personal and global bests based on new evaluations.

üîÄ Combine Both Phases
matlab
Copy
Edit
btp = top half from TLBO
bpso = top half from PSO
finres = [btp; bpso]
Takes the best 50% of solutions from both TLBO (teacher) and PSO stages.

Combines them into a new population for the next phase.

üë®‚Äçüéì 3. LEARNER PHASE (TLBO)
matlab
Copy
Edit
[lpvobj] = learner1(finres, lb, ub);
Each solution learns from another randomly selected solution.

Improves the population without using global best explicitly.

Aims to refine the population further.

üîÅ Stopping Criteria
matlab
Copy
Edit
alpha = min(abs(fpres - fprev));
if alpha < tol: stop
The loop stops when the improvement in fitness becomes very small (tol).

Stores the best solution in bst.

‚úÖ What Your Code Achieves
Phase	Purpose
Teacher Phase (TLBO)	Guides solutions towards best individual
PSO Phase	Adds exploration and memory-based learning
Learner Phase (TLBO)	Encourages peer-to-peer learning to refine solutions

Together, these stages ensure:

Faster convergence

Avoid getting stuck in local optima

Balanced exploration & exploitation

üóÇ Final Output
matlab

Edit
finres ‚Äì Best solutions from TLBO and PSO
srt1 ‚Äì Sorted results after learner phase
bst ‚Äì Best solution found
