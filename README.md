Optimizing EV Charging Stations and Distributed Generators in Smart Grids
## Overview
This repository provides source code, input datasets, and result outputs for the research work titled "Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Distributed Generators in Smart Grids: A Multi-Objective Meta-Heuristic Approach." This work presents a Modified Weighted Teaching-Learning Based PSO Algorithm (MWTLB-PSA) to optimally place Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and Distributed Generators (DGs) in a coupled distribution and road network.

## Key Features
Hybrid Optimization Algorithm (MWTLB-PSA): Combines the exploration strength of PSO with the exploitation ability of Weighted Teaching-Learning Based Optimization for superior convergence and global search capability.

Joint Planning of EVCS and DGs: Simultaneous placement considering power system efficiency and consumer travel behavior in urban road networks.

Consumer Cost Index (EVCCI): Introduces a new metric that quantifies user inconvenience in terms of distance and energy consumed to reach EVCS.

Active Power Loss Index (APLI): Measures power loss reduction after integrating EVCS and DG.

Spatially Coupled Network: Integrates IEEE 33-bus distribution system with a 25-node realistic urban road network.
