### Base Case – No EVCS or DG
Goal: Analyze the network performance without any charging stations or distributed generation.

Steps:

Load the IEEE 33-bus distribution network data.

Perform load flow analysis using the backward/forward sweep method.

Record:

Active Power Loss (APL)

Reactive Power Loss (RPL)

Minimum Bus Voltage

### Case 1 – EVCS Placement Only
Goal: Minimize power loss and EV travel cost by placing only EV Charging Stations.

Steps:

Load both distribution network and road network data.

Define the Multi-Objective Function (MOF) using:

EV Consumer Cost Index (EVCCI)

Active Power Loss Index (APLI)

Initialize the MWTLB-PSA algorithm:

Generate initial population of EVCS locations and sizes.

For each iteration:

Evaluate fitness using MOF.

Update solution using hybrid WTLBO + PSO rules.

Stop when convergence criteria met.

Output optimal EVCS locations, capacities, and corresponding:

APL

EVCCI

Minimum voltage

### Case 2 – DG Placement After EVCS
Goal: Improve voltage profile and reduce power loss after EVCS are placed.

Steps:

Use optimal EVCS locations from Case 1.

Initialize the MWTLB-PSA for DG placement.

Define limits for DG sizes and power constraints.

Optimize:

DG locations and sizes.

Combined MOF with EVCCI and APLI.

Update load flow with both EVCS and DG data.

Record:

Reduced APL and RPL

Improved voltage profile

EVCCI remains same

### Case 3 – Simultaneous Placement of EVCS and DG
Goal: Jointly optimize the placement and sizing of EVCS and DGs for best performance.

Steps:

Load distribution and road network data.

Set constraints for:

EVCS capacities, limits

DG size limits

Voltage and power balance

Initialize MWTLB-PSA with mixed population (EVCS + DG).

Evaluate MOF with both EVCCI and APLI.

Run the algorithm until convergence.

Output:

Best EVCS and DG placements

APL, RPL, EVCCI

Minimum bus voltage

Installation cost
